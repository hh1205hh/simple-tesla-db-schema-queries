# Basic SQL Project: Tesla Company Database

This is a small, basic SQL project that demonstrates database creation and querying. It's built around a fictional database for a company and includes the complete schema, sample data, and a set of 10 practice queries.

This repository is a simple exercise in SQL, covering:

  * **Data Definition Language (DDL):** Creating tables and defining schemas.
  * **Data Manipulation Language (DML):** Inserting data into tables and updating records.
  * **Data Query Language (DQL):** Writing queries to retrieve data, including JOINs, aggregate functions (SUM), and filtering (WHERE).

## How to Use

1.  **Set up your database:** Use the `Tesla-Database.sql` script in your preferred SQL client (MySQL, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, etc.) to create the database, all tables, and insert the sample data.
2.  **Run the queries:** Open `SQL-Answers.sql` to see and run the 10 sample queries against the database.

## Project Contents

  * `Tesla-Database.sql`: The main SQL script to create all tables and populate them with sample data.
  * `SQL-Answers.sql`: A file containing 10 sample SQL queries that demonstrate how to retrieve information from the database.
  * `ERD-Diagram.png`: The Entity-Relationship Diagram showing the database structure and table relationships.
  * `Tesla-CompanyV3.docx`: The original project report (in Hebrew and English) describing the tables and project goals.

## Database Schema (ERD)

The database includes tables for `Employees`, `Departments`, `Projects`, `Customers`, `Orders`, `Products`, and more, all connected by primary and foreign keys.
